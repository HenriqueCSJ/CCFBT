Crappy Code for Boring Tasks (CCFBT) is where I put random code for tasks that I am too lazy to do over and over.

Title: Crappy Code for Boring Tasks (CCFBT)

Description:

Welcome to my quirky corner of the coding world, Crappy Code for Boring Tasks (CCFBT). It's a little like a box full of random stuff, cluttered with scripts that have one thing in common â€“ they don't care about looking pretty, only about getting (**MY**) job done.

Here at CCFBT, I roll up my sleeves and dig into the mundane and specific tasks that computational chemistry software demands, like parsing and analyzing outputs that are as exciting as watching paint dry. These scripts might not be dressed up in the latest coding trends, but they're reliable workhorses, delivering what you need with minimal fuss.

You'll find everything from rudimentary parsers to unassuming visualization tools. They won't be winning any awards for elegance or efficiency, but they're not trying to. They're here to do their job, nothing more.

So, whether you're a computational chemist tired of sifting through tedious data, a coding connoisseur looking for a laugh, or a programming newbie wanting to see what not to do, step into my CCFBT repository. It's not pretty, it's not sophisticated, but it gets the job done.

When it comes to dealing with the boring stuff in computational chemistry, let my crappy code do the work. Remember, there's a certain beauty in code that gets things done, even if it isn't the belle of the ball!
