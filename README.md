# CCFBT
Crappy Code for Boring Tasks (CCFBT) is where I put random code for tasks that I am too lazy to do over and over.

Description:

Welcome to my humble abode of the unrefined, the Crappy Code for Boring Tasks (CCFBT) repository. Imagine an eccentric old attic, filled with quirky scripts that might be less about beauty and more about brute functionality. That's the CCFBT ethos. 

I proudly present to you my collection of code - scripts that may overlook modern coding standards, but do so with a rebellious charm. They're here for one thing, and one thing only - getting those yawn-inducing tasks done, no frills attached.

In this repository, you'll find everything from lackadaisical dipole moment analysis to the most minimalistic 3D vector visualizations. Sure, they're not winning any beauty pageants or speed races anytime soon, but they're not trying to. They're the reliable workhorses, plodding along to get you to your destination.

So, if you're looking for a laugh, a lesson in what not to do, or a tool to tackle a very specific task, you've come to the right place. My CCFBT repository - it's not pretty, it's not stylish, but boy, does it get the job done! 

Remember, when all you want is to get your boring tasks done, let my crappy code do the heavy lifting. There's beauty in simplicity, even if it's a little rough around the edges!
