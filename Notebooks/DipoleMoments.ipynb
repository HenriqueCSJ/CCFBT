    "## Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script is designed for the purpose of analyzing and visualizing dipole moments, specifically represented by vectors S0 and S1 in three-dimensional space. The script provides a comprehensive evaluation of these moments by calculating various quantities of interest, such as their magnitudes, the angle between them, and then converting these computed values to more universally recognized units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why am I doing this? Because the $#%&@! Reviewer #2 told me to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a more detailed breakdown of the operations the script performs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Initialization:** The script initializes two vectors, S0 and S1, which represent the two dipole moments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Computation of Vector Properties:** The dot product and magnitudes (lengths) of the vectors are computed. The angle between these two vectors is then calculated in radians and also converted to degrees for easy interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unit Conversion:** A conversion factor from atomic units to Debye is established and used to express the magnitudes of the vectors in Debye units.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result Display:** The calculated magnitudes of the dipole moments and the angle between them (in both degrees and as a fraction of pi in radians) are printed in a user-friendly manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Vector Visualization:** The script plots these vectors in 3D, starting from the origin and extending beyond it. This visual representation aids in understanding the relationship between the two dipole moments in a more intuitive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Customizable 3D Plot:** The script sets appropriate plot limits based on the maximum vector magnitude, labels the axes, adds a title, and includes a legend. It then displays the 3D plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script serves as a robust tool for anyone interested in dipole moment analysis, providing both a quantitative and a visual understanding of their relationship. Whether you're a student learning about dipole moments, a teacher demonstrating them, or a researcher analyzing them, this script is a valuable resource."
